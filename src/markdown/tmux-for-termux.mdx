# Tmux for Termux

Have you ever wonder how to open multiple sessions in a singel screen in [termux]().

Here is a solution, an open source terminal multiplexer for Linux or Unix operating systems.

> I often used this alot while writing program. 

It was developed by [Nicholas Marriott](https://github.com/nicm) and contribute by [Thomas Adam](https://github.com/ThomasAdam) , [Ben Boeckel](https://github.com/mathstuf) and many more you can check it in the [GitHub Contribution page](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/graphs/contributors).

Tmux is written in C Language and it's open sourced at GitHub. If you think that you can improve the program than you can contribute at [Tumx](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

Now let me tell you who to use it and gain all the full potential of this program.

## Installation ðŸ”§

To install tumx in your termux you will first need to update the packages by typing...

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

After that you need to type a command which will basically install the tumx

```bash
pkg install tmux
```

## Basic command

After you successfully install tmux. You will see message like this 

```bash
Unpacking tmux (3.2) ...
Setting up tmux (3.2) ...
Processing triggers for man (1.14.5-2) ...
```

Now move on the basic commands.

To start the program, first simply type :

```bash
tmux
```
Remember if you want to use this command than first you need to type <br/>` CTRL + b ` after than the command.

> <b>Eg</b> : To split a screen in vertical orientation your need to first type ` CTRL + b ` after than " % " percentage symbol.

- `%` Vertical Split
- `"` Horizontal split 
- `z` Full screen mode for current pane 
- `o` Go to next pane

This are the command commonly use there are more advance thing which i will covering in the part 2.

Here are some of the extra command which will be useful

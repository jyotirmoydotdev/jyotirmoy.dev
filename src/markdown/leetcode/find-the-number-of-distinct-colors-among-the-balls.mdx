## Explanation

In this problem, you are given an integer `limit` and an array of queries. There are `limit + 1` balls (labeled from `0` to `limit`) that are initially uncolored. Each query is of the form `[x, y]`, which means that ball `x` is to be painted with color `y`. After processing each query, the task is to report the number of distinct colors among all balls (note that “uncolored” is not considered a valid color since valid colors start from 1).

### Initial Setup

There are `limit + 1` balls, each initially uncolored. Since the valid color values are guaranteed to be at least 1, a ball with a color value of `0` in our map can be safely assumed to be uncolored.

### Processing Each Query

For each query `[x, y]`:

- Check if Ball is Already Colored:

    - If `ball[x]` is not zero, the ball has been colored before.
    - The count for the previous color (stored in `ball[x]`) is decreased in the `color` map.
    - If the frequency of that previous color becomes zero, it is removed from the map. This step ensures that only active colors (colors that are actually on some ball) are counted.

- Update with the New Color:

    - Increase the count for the new color `y` in the `color` map.
    - Update `ball[x]` with the new color.

- Record the Distinct Colors Count:

    - The number of distinct colors currently used is simply the number of keys in the `color` map, which is appended to the answer list.

This approach guarantees that at every step the answer reflects the exact number of distinct colors among the balls.

**Using two maps enables us to:**

- Quickly update the current state (what color each ball has).

- Efficiently track the count of each color, thereby making it straightforward to determine the number of distinct colors (the number of keys in the `color` map).

This design avoids scanning through all balls after each query, leading to a more efficient solution.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
    Each query involves a constant number of operations (hash map lookups, updates, and possibly deletions), which on average run in O(1) time. Given that there are n queries, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity:**
    In the worst case, if every query assigns a unique ball a unique color, the ball map will hold at most n entries. Similarly, the color map may hold up to n entries (if each color is unique). Thus, the worst-case space complexity is `O(n)`.

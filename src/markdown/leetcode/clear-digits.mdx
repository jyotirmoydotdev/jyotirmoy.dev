## Explanation

The function **`clearDigits`** processes a string by removing every digit it encounters along with the closest non-digit character immediately to its left. It uses a stack (implemented as a slice of bytes) to keep track of the lowercase English letters.

### 1. Iteration and Stack Building
   The function iterates through each character of the input string:
   - If the character is a lowercase letter (between `'a'` and `'z'`), it is appended to the stack.
   - If the character is a digit, the function checks if the stack is not empty and then removes (pops) the last character. This effectively “undoes” the most recent letter addition.

### 2. Edge Case Handling
   The additional check `if len(stack) > 0` ensures that when a digit is encountered with no preceding letter (i.e., the stack is empty), the function does not attempt to pop from an empty slice.

### 3. Example Walkthrough
   Consider the input `s = "cb34"`:
   - **Step 1:** Process `'c'` → Stack becomes `['c']`.
   - **Step 2:** Process `'b'` → Stack becomes `['c', 'b']`.
   - **Step 3:** Process `'3'` (a digit) → Remove the last character (`'b'`), leaving `['c']`.
   - **Step 4:** Process `'4'` (a digit) → Remove the last character (`'c'`), leaving an empty stack.
   - **Result:** The final returned string is `""`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The function processes each character in a single pass, resulting in a time complexity of *`O(n)`*, where *n* is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  In the worst case, when no digits are present, the stack holds all characters, leading to a space complexity of *`O(n)`*.

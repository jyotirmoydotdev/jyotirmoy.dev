## Explanation

The tupleSameProduct function calculates the number of valid tuples based on pairs of numbers that share the same product. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Counting Products

A hash map productCount is created to store the frequency of each product formed by multiplying two different numbers from the **nums** array.

### Iterating Over Pairs

Two nested loops iterate over all unique pairs (i, j) where **i < j**. For each pair, the product is calculated, and the count for that product is incremented in the **productCount** map.

### Calculating the Result

After collecting all product frequencies, the function iterates over the map. For each product with frequency **n**, the formula **(n-1)\*n\*4** is used to calculate the number of valid tuples that can be formed from the pairs that yield this product. The multiplication by 4 accounts for the different tuple orders that can be formed from two distinct pairs sharing the same product.

### Return the Result

The final result, which is the total count of valid tuples, is returned.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**
    The algorithm uses two nested loops to iterate over all unique pairs of elements, which results in **O(n²)** time complexity. In addition, iterating over the keys in the hash map to compute the final result is at most **O(n²)** in the worst case (if every pair produces a unique product), so the overall time complexity remains **O(n²)**.

- **Space Complexity**
    The space complexity is determined by the hash map **productCount**. In the worst-case scenario, where every pair yields a unique product, the hash map can have **O(n²)** entries. Thus, the space complexity is **O(n²)**.

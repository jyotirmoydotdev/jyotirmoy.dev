You are given an integer array `nums` consiting of `2 * n` integers.

you need to divide `nums` into `n` pairs such that:

- Each element belongs to **exactly one pair**.
- The element present in a pair are **equal**.

Return `true` *if nums can be divided into 'n' pairs, otherwise return 'false'*.

**Constraints**:

- `nums.length == 2 * n`
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 500`

## Approach: Hash Map

```go
func divideArray(nums []int) bool {
    hash := make(map[int]int)
    for i := range nums {
        hash[nums[i]]++
    }
    for _, val := range hash {
        if val % 2 != 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true 
}
```

### Intuition

The main idea is to check if every number in the array appears an even number of times. If a number appears an odd number of times, it cannot be completely paired, so the function returns false. Using a hash map to count occurrences makes it easy to verify this condition.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialize a hash map:**  
   Create an empty hash map to store the frequency of each number.

2. **Count frequencies:**  
   Loop through each element in the array and update its count in the hash map.

3. **Check for even counts:**  
   Iterate over the hash map values. If any count is odd, return false.

4. **Return true:**  
   If all counts are even, return true, meaning the array can be divided into equal pairs.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(n)`  
  The algorithm iterates through the array once to build the frequency map and then iterates through the map's values. Both operations are linear with respect to the number of elements.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(n)`  
  In the worst case, if all elements are unique, the hash map will store n elements.

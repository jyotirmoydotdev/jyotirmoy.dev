You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`. Rearrange `nums` such that the following conditions are satisfied:

- Every element less than `pivot` appears before every element greater than `pivot`.
- Every element equal to `pivot` appears in between the elements less than and greater than `pivot`.
- The **relative order** of the elements less than `pivot` and the elements greater than `pivot` is maintained.
    - More formally, consider every `pi`, `pj` where `pi` is the new position of the `iᵗʰ` element and `pj` is the new position of the `jᵗʰ` element. If `i < j` and both elements are smaller (or larger) than `pivot`, then `pi < pj`.

Return `nums` *after the rearrangement.*

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-106 <= nums[i] <= 106`
- `pivot` equals to an element of `nums`.

## Approach 1: Dynamic Slices

```go
func pivotArray(nums []int, pivot int) []int {
	left := make([]int, 0, len(nums))
	mid := make([]int, 0, len(nums))
	right := make([]int, 0, len(nums))

	for _, num := range nums {
		switch {
		case num < pivot:
			left = append(left, num)
		case num == pivot:
			mid = append(mid, num)
		default:
			right = append(right, num)
		}
	}

	return slices.Concat(left, mid, right)
}
```

### Intuition

The problem requires rearranging an array such that:
1. Elements smaller than the pivot appear first.
2. Elements equal to the pivot appear next.
3. Elements greater than the pivot appear last.
   
To achieve this, we can iterate through the array and classify each element into one of three separate lists (`left`, `mid`, and `right`). Finally, we concatenate these lists to obtain the desired order while maintaining relative positioning.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize three slices:
   - `left` for elements less than `pivot`
   - `mid` for elements equal to `pivot`
   - `right` for elements greater than `pivot`
2. Iterate through `nums` and append each element to its respective slice based on comparison with `pivot`.
3. Concatenate and return the three slices.

### Complexity Analysis
 
- Time Complexity: O(N)
    - We iterate through `nums` once, processing each element in **O(1)** time.
    - The final concatenation using `slices.Concat()` is **O(N)**.
    - Overall, the algorithm runs in **O(N)** time.

- Space Complexity: O(N)
    - Three separate slices (`left`, `mid`, `right`) store elements temporarily, requiring **O(N)** additional space.
    - The final result uses the same space, making the overall auxiliary space complexity **O(N)**.

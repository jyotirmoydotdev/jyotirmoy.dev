## Explanation

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.  
- A **strictly increasing subarray** is one where every element is greater than its previous element (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
- A **strictly decreasing subarray** is one where every element is less than its previous element (e.g., `[3, 2, 1]`).

The solution maintains two counters:
- `inc` for the current strictly increasing subarray.
- `dec` for the current strictly decreasing subarray.

At each step, based on the relationship between consecutive elements, we update these counters and keep track of the maximum length encountered.

---

### Approach

- **Step 1:** Check if the array has less than two elements. If yes, return its length since a single element (or empty array) is trivially monotonic.
- **Step 2:** Initialize two counters, `inc` and `dec`, to 1 and a variable `res` to keep track of the maximum subarray length found.
- **Step 3:** Iterate through the array comparing each element with the next:
  - If the current element is less than the next, it indicates a strictly increasing subarray. Increment `inc` and reset `dec` to 1.
  - If the current element is greater than the next, it indicates a strictly decreasing subarray. Increment `dec` and reset `inc` to 1.
  - If the elements are equal, reset both counters to 1 as the monotonicity is broken.
- **Step 4:** Update `res` with the maximum value between `inc` and `dec` after each comparison.
- **Step 5:** Return the value of `res` which represents the longest monotonic subarray.

### Example Walkthrough

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]`  
- Start with `inc = 1`, `dec = 1`, `res = 1`.
- **Iteration 1:** Compare `1` and `3`: `1 < 3` → `inc = 2`, `dec = 1`; update `res = 2`.
- **Iteration 2:** Compare `3` and `5`: `3 < 5` → `inc = 3`, `dec = 1`; update `res = 3`.
- **Iteration 3:** Compare `5` and `4`: `5 > 4` → `dec = 2`, `inc = 1`; `res` remains `3`.
- **Iteration 4:** Compare `4` and `2`: `4 > 2` → `dec = 3`, `inc = 1`; update `res = 3` (the maximum remains 3).

The longest strictly monotonic subarray is of length **3**.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [9, 7, 4, 2, 3, 5]`  
- Start with `inc = 1`, `dec = 1`, `res = 1`.
- **Iteration 1:** Compare `9` and `7`: `9 > 7` → `dec = 2`, `inc = 1`; update `res = 2`.
- **Iteration 2:** Compare `7` and `4`: `7 > 4` → `dec = 3`, `inc = 1`; update `res = 3`.
- **Iteration 3:** Compare `4` and `2`: `4 > 2` → `dec = 4`, `inc = 1`; update `res = 4`.
- **Iteration 4:** Compare `2` and `3`: `2 < 3` → `inc = 2`, `dec = 1`; `res` remains `4`.
- **Iteration 5:** Compare `3` and `5`: `3 < 5` → `inc = 3`, `dec = 1`; `res` remains `4`.

The longest strictly monotonic subarray is of length **4**.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The solution iterates over the array once, making it **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  The solution uses a constant amount of extra space (a few counters and a variable for the result), making it **O(1)**.

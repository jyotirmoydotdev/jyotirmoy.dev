You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n * n` with values in the range `[1, n²]`. Each integer appears **exactly once** except `a` which appears twice and `b` which is **missing**. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers `a` and `b`.

Return *a **0-indexed** integer array `ans` of size `2` where `ans[0]` equals to `a` and `ans[1]` equals to `b`*.


**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n == grid.length == grid[i].length <= 50`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= n * n`
- For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` there is exactly one `x` that is not equal to any of the grid members.
- For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` there is exactly one `x` that is equal to exactly two of the grid members.
- For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` except two of them there is exatly one pair of `i, j` that `0 <= i, j <= n - 1` and `grid[i][j] == x`.


## Approach: Hash Map Counting

```go
func findMissingAndRepeatedValues(grid [][]int) []int {
    hash := make(map[int]int)
    for _, nums := range grid {
        for _, num := range nums {
            hash[num]++
        }
    }

    n, count, rep, dup := len(grid[0]), 0, 0, 0
    for i := 1; i <= n*n; i++ {
        if count == 2 {
            return []int{dup, rep}
        }
        if hash[i] == 2 {
            dup = i
            count++
        }
        if hash[i] == 0 {
            rep = i
            count++
        }
    }
    return []int{dup, rep}
}
```

### Intuition

In an $n \times n$ grid, numbers range from 1 to $n^2$. Every number should appear exactly once except one number that appears twice (the duplicate) and one that is missing. By counting the frequency of each number, we can identify:
- The number with a frequency of 2 as the duplicate.
- The number with a frequency of 0 as the missing value.

### Algorithm

1. **Count Frequencies:**  
   Traverse the grid and use a hash map to count how many times each number appears.
2. **Identify Special Numbers:**  
   Loop from 1 to $ n^2 $:
   - If a number’s count is 2, record it as the duplicate.
   - If a number’s count is 0, record it as the missing value.
3. **Return Answer:**  
   Return an array containing the duplicate and the missing numbers.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  $ O(n^2) $  
  We traverse each element in the grid (which contains $ n^2 $ elements) and then iterate over the range $ [1, n^2] $ to check counts.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  $ O(n^2) $  
  The hash map stores counts for up to $ n^2 $ numbers.

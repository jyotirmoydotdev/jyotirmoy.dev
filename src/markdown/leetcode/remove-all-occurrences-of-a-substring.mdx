Given two strings `s` and `part`, perform the following operation on `s` until **all** occurrences of the substring `part` are removed:

- Find the **leftmost** occurrence of the substring `part` and **remove** it from `s`.

Return `s` after removing all occurrences of `part`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= part.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `part` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Stack

```go
func removeOccurrences(s string, part string) string {
	stk := []byte{}
	strLenght := len(s)
	partLength := len(part)

	for index := 0; index < strLenght; index++ {
		stk = append(stk, s[index])
		if (len(stk) >= partLength && checkMatch(stk, part, partLength)){
			for j := 0; j < partLength; j++ {
				stk = stk[:len(stk)-1]
			}
		}
	}

	result := ""
	for (len(stk)>0){
		result = string(stk[len(stk)-1]) + result
		stk = stk[:len(stk)-1]
	}
    return result
}

func checkMatch( stk []byte, part string, partLength int ) bool{
	temp := stk 
	for partIndex := partLength - 1; partIndex >= 0; partIndex-- {
		if temp[len(temp)-1] != part[partIndex] {
			return false
		}
		temp = temp[:len(temp)-1]
	}
	return true;
}
```

### Intuition

The goal is to remove all occurrences of the substring `part` from the string `s`. Instead of scanning and reconstructing the string multiple times, we simulate the process with a stack. As we iterate through `s`, we push each character onto the stack. After each push, we check if the top of the stack ends with `part`. If it does, we remove (pop) those characters immediately. This way, the removal is done incrementally and efficiently.

### Algorithm

1. **Initialization:**  
   - Create an empty stack (implemented as a slice of bytes) called `stk`.
   - Determine the lengths of `s` and `part` (stored in `strLenght` and `partLength` respectively).

2. **Processing Characters:**  
   - Loop through each character in `s`.
   - Append the current character to `stk`.
   - If the size of `stk` is at least as long as `partLength`, call the helper function `checkMatch` to see if the last characters of the stack match `part`.
   - If a match is found, remove the last `partLength` characters from `stk`.

3. **Constructing the Result:**  
   - After processing all characters, rebuild the final string by popping all characters from `stk` and concatenating them in reverse order (since the stack's order is from bottom to top).

4. **Helper Function - checkMatch:**  
   - This function checks if the top of the stack matches `part` by comparing the last `partLength` characters in the stack (in reverse order) with `part`.
   - It returns `true` if they match; otherwise, `false`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  In the worst-case scenario, for each of the n characters in `s`, we may perform a check that takes up to m comparisons (where m is the length of `part`). Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is `O(n â‹… m)`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  The stack `stk` can hold up to n characters in the worst case. Additionally, the helper function uses a temporary variable for comparisons. This gives an overall space complexity of `O(n + m)`.

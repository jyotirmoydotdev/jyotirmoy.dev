Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is possible to represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `y == 3x`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10⁷`

## Approach: Ternary Representation

```go
func checkPowersOfThree(n int) bool {
    for n > 0 {
        if n % 3 == 2 {
            return false
        }
        n /= 3
    }
    return true
}
```

### Intuition
The problem asks whether a given number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three. This is similar to how every number has a unique binary representation (using powers of 2). Here, we use a ternary (base-3) representation instead. In a valid representation, each digit should be either 0 or 1. If any digit is 2, it means that a power of three is being used twice, which is not allowed.

### Algorithm
1. **Loop until `n` becomes 0:**
   - Calculate `n % 3` to obtain the current digit in the ternary representation.
   - If the digit is 2, return `false` immediately because it indicates the use of a power of three twice.
   - Otherwise, perform integer division `n /= 3` to move to the next digit.
2. **Return `true`** once the loop completes without encountering a digit 2, meaning the number can be written as a sum of distinct powers of three.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log₃(n))`
  Since we continuously divide `n` by 3, the number of iterations is proportional to the logarithm of `n` to the base 3.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

```sql
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
```

product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

## Selecting rows based on conditions

```sql
-- PostgreSQL

SELECT 
    product_id 
FROM 
    Products 
WHERE 
    low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

The keyword `SELECT` is used to specify the columns that we want to retrieve from the table `Products`. In this scenario, we want to retrieve the `product_id` column.

The keyword `WHERE` is used to filter the rows in the table `Products` based on specific conditions, which the `low_fats` column has the value "Y" (indicating low-fat products) and the `recyclable` column has the value "Y" (indicating recyclable products). We use the logical operator `AND` to combine both conditions, ensuring that the final result includes only product IDs for products that are both low fat and recyclable.

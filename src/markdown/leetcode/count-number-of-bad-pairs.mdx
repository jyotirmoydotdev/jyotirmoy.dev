## Explanation

In this post, we'll explore an efficient solution to the problem of counting **bad pairs** in an integer array. A pair of indices **(i, j)** is considered a **bad pair** if:

- **i < j**, and
- **nums[j] - nums[i] ≠ j - i**

A brute-force solution that checks every possible pair would run in *O(n²)* time, which isn't feasible for large arrays. Instead, we can solve the problem in *O(n)* time by cleverly transforming the condition and using a frequency map.

## The Key Observation

Notice that the condition for a pair **not** to be bad (i.e., a **good pair**) is: `nums[j] - nums[i] = j - i`

This can be rearranged into: `nums[j] - nums[i] = j - i`

In other words, two indices **i** and **j** form a good pair if they share the same value of **nums[k] - k**. With this insight, we can count the number of good pairs, and by extension, deduce the number of bad pairs.

For each index **i**, the total number of pairs that can be formed with previous indices is **i**. If **hash[diff]** (where **diff = nums[i] - i**) is the number of previous indices with the same difference, then **hash[diff]** represents the count of good pairs ending at **i**. Consequently, the number of **bad pairs** formed with index **i** is:

`bad_pairs = i - hash[diff]`

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialize a Frequency Map**  
   We use a map (`hash`) to count how many times each value of **nums[i] - i** has been encountered.

2. **Iterate Over the Array**  
   For each index **i** and its corresponding value **num**, calculate the difference:

   ```go
   diff := num - i
   ```
   
3. **Count Bad Pairs at Each Step**  
   - Each new index **i** forms **i** pairs with all previous indices.
   - Among these, the number of **good pairs** is exactly the count of previous indices where **nums[k] - k == diff** (i.e., `hash[diff]`).
   - Hence, the number of **bad pairs** contributed by the current index is:

     ```go
     counter += i - hash[diff]
     ```
     
4. **Update the Map**  
   After processing the current index, increment the count for the current difference:

   ```go
   hash[diff]++
   ```

5. **Return the Result**  
   Finally, cast the counter to an `int64` and return it.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:  
  The function processes the array in a single pass, performing constant-time operations (map lookups and updates) for each element. Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  The frequency map stores counts for each unique difference **(nums[i] - i)**. In the worst case, where every element results in a unique difference, the space complexity is **O(n)**.
